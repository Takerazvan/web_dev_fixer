## Description

This is a CodePen Clone app, a web-based IDE for front-end designers and developers. It provides a platform where users can create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets, also known as 'pens', and see the live preview of their code. It's a great tool for testing, showcasing, and sharing front-end code.

## Features

1. **Real-time Preview**: See the changes in real-time as you modify the code.
2. **Multi-Language Support**: Supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. **Save Pens**: Users can save their 'pens' for future reference and modification.
4. **Dark Mode Interface**: Offers a dark mode interface to ease the strain on the eyes and enhance the coding experience.
5. **Responsive Design**: The app's layout is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile browsers.
## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd codepen-clone
3.  Install the necessary packages: npm install 
4. Run the application: npm start

5. The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.


   
## Backend

The backend of this application is developed using Java Spring Boot, offering a robust framework to build the server-side of the application. It interacts with PostgreSQL database to store and manage the user-created pens. Here is the basic setup guide:

### Setting up the Backend

1. Install [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html) (version 15 or later).
2. Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (for dependency management).
3. Set up your Spring Boot application by following the [official guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/).

## Database

The project uses PostgreSQL as its database system. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and set up a new database.
2. Configure your `application.properties` file in your Spring Boot application to connect to your PostgreSQL database. 



## Usage

1. **Creating a New Pen**:
- Navigate to the home page and click on 'Create New Pen' to start creating your code snippet.

2. **Editing a Pen**:
- Use the editor panels to add or modify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
- Switch between different panels using the tabs at the top of the editor.

3. **Saving a Pen**:
- Click the 'Save Pen' button to save your pen.
